# Animating Websites with HTML, CSS, and JS 

This project demonstrates how to build and animate a modern website using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
The focus is on creating a **header section with animations**, where elements fade, slide, and appear with timed delays to create a smooth, professional experience.

---

##  Features
- **Animated Header Section**: Navigation, titles, and footer elements animate in sequence.
- **Custom Cursor**: A styled cursor that scales and follows mouse movement.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Implemented with [Locomotive Scroll](https://locomotivemtl.github.io/locomotive-scroll/).
- **GSAP Animations**: Used for staggered fade-ins, translations, and hover effects.
- **Responsive Design**: Works across desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.
- **Interactive Sections**:
  - `index.html`: Hero + footer animations
  - `work.html`: Grid/List toggle with video hover effects
  - `playground.html`: Horizontal video scroller with fade-in on scroll
  - `contact.html`: Styled form with consistent theme
